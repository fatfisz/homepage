  Hi, welcome to my blog!
  I will be writing mostly about the front-end stuff, JS in general, and also a bit about what I do outside of work.
  I like to eat outside sometimes, so you can expect some posts with photos about places to eat in Warsaw.
  In this post, however, I won't be writing about food.
