        Introduction
      </h3>
      <p>
        Hi, welcome to my blog!
        I will be writing mostly about the front-end stuff, JS in general, and also a bit about what I do outside of work.
        I like to eat outside sometimes, so you can expect some posts with photos about places to eat in Warsaw.
        In this post, however, I won't be writing about food.

      <h3>
        The problem
      </h3>
      <p>
        When I was working on this website I found myself needing a non-trivial background.
        It had to consist of a pattern that covers the whole viewport, and a single-color overlay beneath the text.
        The purpose of the overlay was to make the text more clear - otherwise the pattern was introducing too much noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first version the overlay was only surrounding the text, but the idea was discarded after consulting with one of the wonderful designers I have a pleasure working with at <a href="https://codility.com">Codility</a>.
        Instead I was supposed to make the overlay take the whole height of the viewport.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had previously created a similar background for another website (which is no more, unfortunately), so I knew a way of achieving the desired effect.
        It was based on having an element that would have the height of <em>at least</em> the viewport - if there was more content, it should grow accordingly.
        This solution, while it certainly works, involves setting the (min-)height of all of the parent elements to 100% - up to <code>body</code> and <code>html</code>.
        It is as cumbersome as it sounds, so I decided to look for something else.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Multiple backgrounds to the rescue
      </h3>
      <p>
        I observed that what I need is something similar to the existing pattern background - with the difference being the overlay pattern has to be 1px Ã— 1px and stretch to different widths depending on the size of the screen.
        The solution would require less code and be more easy to work with than the <code>height: 100%</code> one.
        The only problem was how to make that image.
      </p>
      <p>
        One option is to have a separate image served - I didn't pursue this one, because an additional request for such a small thing is too unreasonable for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another option is to use a data URI.
        It's a known technique for inlining images in the stylesheets.
        Though <a href="https://csswizardry.com/2017/02/base64-encoding-and-performance/">it is not always recommended</a>, there's no problem with using it for one small image.
        Usually the image is base64-encoded, but then it's hard to tweak the color.
        For that reason I also discarded binary formats.
        Then I tried inlining a one pixel svg:
      </p>
      <CodeExample type="css">{stripIndent`
        body {
          background-image:
            url('data:image/svg+xml;utf8,<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 1 1"><rect fill="rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.85)" x="0" y="0" width="1" height="1" /></svg>'),
            url(/static/background.svg);
        }
      `}</CodeExample>
      <p>
        <em>
          Take note of the order of the images: the top-most one on the page should be first in the declaration.
          This doesn't seem to be most intuitive, so I'm just leaving this here.
        </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This solution is not the most sublime, but I was prepared to live with it.
        That is, until I found out it is not working in Edge 15, no matter what I do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I turned to my good friend, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/background-image">the MDN docs</a>, to see what are the other options for the background image.
        There I found what I ultimately used - the linear gradient!
        The idea is so simple, yet I had to jump through many hoops in order to arrive at this solution.
        Maybe it's because I didn't think of one pixel as a gradient material?
        Anyway, that's what I came up with:
      </p>
      <CodeExample type="css">{stripIndent`
        body {
          background-image:
            linear-gradient(0deg, \${overlayColor}, \${overlayColor}),
            url(/static/background.svg);
        }
      `}</CodeExample>
      <p>
        The <code>{'${overlayColor}'}</code> bit is there because I have the styles declared inside a <a href="https://github.com/zeit/styled-jsx">styled-jsx</a> block.
        Anyway, this means I can easily tweak the color, which was one of my goals.
        By the way, there was another requirement - different widths depending on the screen size.
        Here's the code that takes care of that:
      </p>
      <CodeExample type="css">{stripIndent`
        body {
          background-position: center top;
          background-repeat: repeat-y, repeat;
          background-size: 100% 1px, 400px;
        }
        @media (min-width: 576px) {
          body {
            background-size: 540px 1px, 400px;
          }
        }
        @media (min-width: 768px) {
          body {
            background-size: 720px 1px, 400px;
          }
        }
        @media (min-width: 992px) {
          body {
            background-size: 960px 1px, 400px;
          }
        }
        @media (min-width: 1200px) {
          body {
            background-size: 1140px 1px, 400px;
          }
        }
      `}</CodeExample>
      <p>
        Setting <code>repeat-y</code> for the pixel is crucial, otherwise the whole viewport would be covered.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Summary
      </h3>
      <p>
        The linear gradient solution was not the first one that came to my mind when I was tackling the background problem.
        It is however simple, straightforward, and works in all browsers that support multiple backgrounds (all modern ones, IE 9+) and the gradient (all modern ones, IE 10+).

        That's all for this post, I hope you find it useful.
        Thanks for reading!
